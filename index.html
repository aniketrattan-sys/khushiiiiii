        I’m so glad HOP happened.<br>
        Even when I didn’t feel like going at all,<br>
        it somehow turned into one of the most important moments for me.<br>
        Because it led me to you, my love.
      </p>

      <p class="fade">
        I love how sweet you are without trying.<br>
        I love your smile, your eyes, your laugh, especially how loud it gets.<br>
        I love making you laugh and watching you be fully yourself.
      </p>

      <p class="fade">
        From your weird harkate to your smallest habits<br>
        (we can work on the messy part tho, haha),<br>
        I’ve grown to adore every part of you.<br>
        Being around you feels easy in a way I don’t take for granted.
      </p>

      <p class="fade">
        When I’m with you, everything just feels right.<br>
        I feel like my most authentic self.
      </p>

      <p class="fade">
        You are genuinely an incredible person.<br>
        Getting to know you has been one of the nicest surprises in my life.<br>
        I’m grateful for you, for us, and for the space we share.
      </p>

      <p class="fade ending">
        And if I’m being honest,<br>
        I’d really like to keep choosing you.<br>
        To make more memories, have more laughs,<br>
        and see where this takes us — together.
      </p>

      <p class="fade ending">
        I love you. More than I can put into words.<br>
        So… I wanted to ask you something.
